"""Salesforce sub-agent.

Searches an organization's Salesforce document library (Salesforce Files) via the
REST/SOSL API using an app-only (2LO / client-credentials) flow. Salesforce
full-text-indexes uploaded documents; the client downloads the top hits and
extracts a text excerpt. Deployed to Cloud Run and reached by
the root Code Assist agent over A2A (the A2A surface is wired automatically by the
scaffold in `app/fast_api_app.py` + `app/app_utils/a2a.py`).
