    A ``RemoteA2aAgent`` is a non-LlmAgent: it has no ``output_key``, and the
    workflow ``JoinNode`` does not capture its output. Persisting the reply to
    shared state (a tracked state delta) lets the synthesizer read it via an
    ``{state_key?}`` instruction template.

        state_key: The session-state key to write the agent's reply into.
