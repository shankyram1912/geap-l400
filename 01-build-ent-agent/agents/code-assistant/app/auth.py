"""ADC-based auth helpers: an httpx client for auth-gated A2A sub-agents, and

`google.auth.default()` resolves to your user credentials locally (via
`gcloud auth application-default login`) and to the runtime service account when
deployed on Agent Runtime, so the same helpers work in both environments without
