"""Stack Exchange agent (LangGraph, served natively over A2A).

Same functionality as the adk_lab agent: a single-node graph whose node runs the
LangChain StackExchangeTool on the latest user message and returns the result.
No LLM. The LangGraph Agent Server (langgraph-api) exposes this graph over A2A
at /a2a/{assistant_id} with an auto-generated agent card, so the root Code
Assist agent can consume it via A2A.

The state has a `messages` key (required for A2A "text" parts).
